description: >-
  Systctl is an interface to modify kernel parameters at runtime. Sysctl allows
  read and write access to the parameters under /proc/sys.

  impact: High
  description: >-
    Sysctl is an interface that enables the container’s parameters to be
    changed, which could allow the container to grab more CPU resources than
    it’s allowed by its quota. This may starve other containers from CPU cycles,
    compromising the operations of the container, host and even the entire
    cluster.

    Some of the sysctl interfaces allow the container to affect the performance
    of other containers and/or the host.
